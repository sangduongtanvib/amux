## Why amux?

| Problem | amux's solution |
|---------|----------------|
| Claude Code crashes at 3am from context compaction | **[Self-healing watchdog](https://amux.io/features/self-healing/)** — auto-compacts, restarts, replays last message |
| Can't monitor 10+ sessions from one place | **[Web dashboard](https://amux.io/features/web-dashboard/)** — live status, token spend, peek into any session |
| Agents duplicate work on the same task | **Kanban board** with atomic task claiming (SQLite CAS) |
| No way to manage agents from your phone | **[Mobile PWA](https://amux.io/features/mobile-pwa/)** — works on iOS/Android, offline support with Background Sync |
| Agents can't coordinate with each other | **[REST API orchestration](https://amux.io/features/agent-coordination/)** — send messages, peek output, claim tasks between sessions |

---

## Key Features

- **Self-healing** — auto-compacts context, restarts on corruption, unblocks stuck prompts. [Learn more →](https://amux.io/features/self-healing/)
- **Parallel agents** — run dozens of sessions, each with a UUID that survives stop/start
- **Web dashboard** — session cards, live terminal peek, file explorer, search across all output. [Learn more →](https://amux.io/features/web-dashboard/)
- **Kanban board** — SQLite-backed with auto-generated keys, atomic claiming, custom columns, iCal sync
- **Agent orchestration** — agents discover peers and delegate work via REST API + shared global memory. [Learn more →](https://amux.io/features/agent-coordination/)
- **Mobile PWA** — installable on iOS/Android, Background Sync replays commands on reconnect. [Learn more →](https://amux.io/features/mobile-pwa/)
- **Token tracking** — per-session daily spend with cache reads broken out
- **Conversation fork** — clone session history to new sessions on separate branches
- **Git conflict detection** — warns when agents share a dir + branch, one-click isolation
- **Built-in cron** — schedule recurring commands, computed atomically in SQLite
- **Single file** — ~12,000 lines of Python + inline HTML/CSS/JS. Edit it; it restarts on save. [Learn more →](https://amux.io/features/single-file-architecture/)

## How It Works

### Status Detection

Parses ANSI-stripped tmux output — no hooks, no patches, no modifications to Claude Code.

### Self-Healing Watchdog

| Condition | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Context < 20% | Sends `/compact` (5-min cooldown) |
| `redacted_thinking … cannot be modified` | Restarts + replays last message |
| Stuck waiting + `CC_AUTO_CONTINUE=1` | Auto-responds based on prompt type |
| YOLO session + safety prompt | Auto-answers (never fires on model questions) |

### Agent-to-Agent Orchestration

```bash
# Send a task to another session
curl -sk -X POST -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{"text":"implement the login endpoint and report back"}' \
  $AMUX_URL/api/sessions/worker-1/send

# Atomically claim a board item
curl -sk -X POST $AMUX_URL/api/board/PROJ-5/claim

# Watch another session's output
curl -sk "$AMUX_URL/api/sessions/worker-1/peek?lines=50" | \
  python3 -c "import json,sys; print(json.load(sys.stdin).get('output',''))"
```

Agents get the full API reference in their global memory, so plain-English orchestration just works.

## Web Dashboard

- **Session cards** — live status (working / needs input / idle), token stats, quick-action chips
- **Peek mode** — full scrollback with search, file previews, and a send bar
- **Workspace** — full-screen tiled layout to watch multiple agents side by side
- **Board** — kanban backed by SQLite, with atomic task claiming, iCal sync, and custom columns
- **Reports** — pluggable spend dashboards pulling from vendor billing APIs

## CLI

```bash
amux register <name> --dir <path> [--yolo] [--model sonnet]
amux start <name>
amux stop <name>
amux attach <name>          # attach to tmux
amux peek <name>            # view output without attaching
amux send <name> <text>     # send text to a session
amux exec <name> -- <prompt> # register + start + send in one shot
amux ls                     # list sessions
amux serve                  # start web dashboard
```

Session names support prefix matching — `amux attach my` resolves to `myproject` if unambiguous.

---

## Install

Requires `tmux` and `python3`.

```bash
git clone <repo> && cd amux
./install.sh   # installs amux (alias: cc) to /usr/local/bin
```

### HTTPS

Auto-generates TLS in order: Tailscale cert → mkcert → self-signed fallback. For phone access, Tailscale is the easiest path. [Remote access guide →](https://amux.io/guides/remote-access-tailscale/)

### Trusting the certificate on your phone

The PWA uses a service worker for offline support — managing sessions, checking the board, and sending messages all work without a connection. For the service worker to register, your phone's browser must trust the HTTPS certificate. If you're using mkcert, your phone won't trust the CA by default. Serve it over HTTP so your phone can download and install it:

```bash
python3 -c "
import http.server, os, socketserver
CA = os.path.expanduser('~/Library/Application Support/mkcert/rootCA.pem')
class H(http.server.BaseHTTPRequestHandler):
    def do_GET(self):
        if self.path == '/':
            self.send_response(200); self.send_header('Content-Type','text/html'); self.end_headers()
            self.wfile.write(b'<a href=\"/rootCA.pem\">Download CA cert</a>')
        elif self.path == '/rootCA.pem':
            data = open(CA,'rb').read()
            self.send_response(200); self.send_header('Content-Type','application/x-pem-file')
            self.send_header('Content-Disposition','attachment; filename=\"rootCA.pem\"')
            self.send_header('Content-Length',len(data)); self.end_headers(); self.wfile.write(data)
socketserver.TCPServer.allow_reuse_address = True
http.server.HTTPServer(('0.0.0.0', 8888), H).serve_forever()
"
```

Then open `http://<your-ip>:8888` on your phone (use your Tailscale IP if on Tailscale, or LAN IP if on the same Wi-Fi).

**iOS:** Settings → General → VPN & Device Management → install the profile, then Settings → General → About → Certificate Trust Settings → enable full trust.

**Android:** Settings → Security → Install a certificate → CA certificate → select the downloaded file.

## Security

Local-first. No auth built in — use Tailscale or bind to localhost. Never expose port 8822 to the internet.
